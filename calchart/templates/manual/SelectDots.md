## Individual selection

Selecting a dot is as easy as using the selection tool <i class="icon-mouse-pointer"></i> (shortcut: S) and clicking a dot. Clicking away from the dot will deselect the dot.

You can also shift + click to select multiple dots individually.

## Mass selection

Using the selection tool, you can also mass select dots by clicking and dragging. Upon dragging, a rectangular box will appear, selecting dots as it overlaps them.

You can also use the lasso tool <i class="icon-lasso"></i> (shortcut: shift + S) to draw an arbitrary shape and select any dots that lie within the drawn area.

## Selection panel

The dot context also displays a panel on the screen. In this panel, you can select dots by label or by dot type (shift + click will add the corresponding dots to the selection).
