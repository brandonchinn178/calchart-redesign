## Manual adjustments

After <a href="{% page 'editing-dots/selecting-dots' %}">selecting dots</a>, you can use the selection tool <i class="icon-mouse-pointer"></i> to click and drag dots to a new location.

You can also use the arrow keys to nudge dots by a step (shift + arrow nudges by 4 steps).

To swap two dots, use the Swap tool <i class="icon-exchange"></i> (shortcut: W). Clicking on two dots consecutively will swap the two dots' positions.
