## Description

This continuity tells dots to execute a counter march continuity. This continuity is similar to the follow the leader continuity, except the first dot goes to the last dot in the line.

## Parameters

- **Number of beats**: By default, counter march continuities use the remaining time in a stuntsheet, but you can also specify a number of beats to execute the continuity for.

### Dot Order

To edit the dot order, click on the <i class="icon-ellipsis-h"></i> icon.

This will display a panel containing all of the dots of the given dot type. You can click and drag dot labels to be in the correct order. Each dot will follow the dot beneath them, so the top-most dot will go towards the dot second from the top. The bottom-most dot will follow the top-most dot.

You can click on the <i class="icon-reverse"></i> icon to reverse the order of the dots.

To exit editing the dot order, click on the <i class="icon-check"></i> icon.
