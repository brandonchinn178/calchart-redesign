## Description

This continuity tells dots to execute either the DMHS or HSDM continuity. For the DMHS continuity, dots will move as far diagonally as possible (diagonal step, 45 degrees) to their next position, then move straight to their spot (and vice-versa for HSDM).

## Parameters

- **End**: This field tells dots what to do after arriving at their spot. Dots can either mark time or close after finishing their movements.
- **Final orientation**: This field tells dots which direction to face while mark timing or when closed at the end of the movement.
