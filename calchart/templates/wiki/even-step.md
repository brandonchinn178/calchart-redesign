## Description

This continuity tells dots to go directly to their next position, using the rest of the remaining time.

## Parameters

- **Orientation**: This field tells dots which direction to face when moving. By default, dots face the direction of travel, but this can be changed to have dots face forward while moving. "Default" has dots face the same orientation as the stuntsheet (e.g. if the stuntsheet is an east-facing formation, then dots will slide facing east).
