## Description

This continuity tells dots to execute a follow-the-leader continuity, where the first dot travels along a designated path and every subsequent dot follows the dot preceding it.

Dots will use a DMHS continuity to go to the next dot position or reference point.

## Parameters

### Dot Order

To edit the dot order, click on the <i class="icon-ellipsis-h"></i> icon.

This will display a panel containing all of the dots of the given dot type. You can click and drag dot labels to be in the correct order. The top-most dot will be the first dot in the path. The second dot from the top will follow the top dot, and so on.

You can click on the <i class="icon-reverse"></i> icon to reverse the order of the dots.

To exit editing the dot order, click on the <i class="icon-check"></i> icon.

### Path

To edit the path of the first dot, click on the <i class="icon-crosshairs"></i> icon.

To add a reference point to the path, click on the <i class="icon-plus-square-o"></i> icon. Then clicking anywhere on the field will add a point to that position.

To move a reference point, click on the <i class="icon-mouse-pointer"></i> icon and you can click and drag any reference point.

To remove a reference point from the path, click on the <i class="icon-minus-square-o"></i> icon. Clicking on a reference point will remove it from the path.

A panel is also displayed containing the coordinates of the path. These coordinates can be reordered by clicking and dragging. When done editing the path, click on the <i class="icon-check"></i> icon.
