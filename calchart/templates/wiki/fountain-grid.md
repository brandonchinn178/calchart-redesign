## Description

This continuity tells dots to execute the standard EWNS or NSEW continuity. For the EWNS continuity, dots will move as far east or west as possible to get to their next position, then move north/south to arrive at their position (vice-versa for NSEW).

## Parameters

- **End**: This field tells dots what to do after arriving at their spot. Dots can either mark time or close after finishing their movements.
- **Final orientation**: This field tells dots which direction to face while mark timing or when closed at the end of the movement.
