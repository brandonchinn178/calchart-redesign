## Individual selection

Selecting a dot is as easy as using the selection tool <i class="icon-mouse-pointer"></i> (shortcut: S) and clicking a dot. Clicking away from the dot will deselect the dot.

You can also shift + click to select multiple dots individually.

## Mass selection

Using the selection tool, you can also mass select dots by clicking and dragging. Upon dragging, a rectangular box will appear, selecting dots as it overlaps them.

You can also use the lasso tool <i class="icon-lasso"></i> (shortcut: shift + S) to draw an arbitrary shape and select any dots that lie within the drawn area.

You can select all dots with the keyboard shortcut ctrl + A (cmd on Mac).

## Selection panel

The dot context also displays a panel on the screen. In this panel, you can select dots by label or by dot type.

To select a single dot by label, click on a dot's label. Ctrl + click (cmd on Mac) will add the dot to the selection. To select a range of dots, click on the first dot and then shift + click on the last dot. Every dot between those two dots will be selected.

To select all dots of a dot type, click on the corresponding dot type. Shift + click will add the dot type to the current selection.
