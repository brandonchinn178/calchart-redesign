## Setting up a show

When first opening a show, a popup will display asking for the following information:

- **Number of dots**: The number of dots that will be marching a show. This currently cannot be changed later on.
- **Dot format**: The format of the dot labels in the show. This currently cannot be changed later on.
- **Field type**: The field that the show will be performed on, e.g. College Field, Tunnel. *This can be overridden on a per-stuntsheet basis, so this value should be the field type for the majority of the show.*

## Editing show properties

After a show has been created, you can edit show-wide properties by going to File > Edit show properties. This will display a popup asking for the following information:

- **Field type**: The field that the show will be performed on, e.g. College Field, Tunnel.
- **Beats per step**: The number of beats per step for movements in the show. *This can be overridden on a per-stuntsheet or per-continuity basis, so this value should be the number of beats per step for the majority of the show.*
- **Step type**: The type of marching for movements in the show, e.g. High Step, Mini Military. *This can be overridden on a per-stuntsheet or per-continuity basis, so this value should be the step type for the majority of the show.*
- **Orientation**: The orientation of the show, e.g. East-facing or West-facing show. *This can be overridden on a per-stuntsheet or per-continuity basis, so this value should be the orientation for the majority of the show.*
