# Calchart's Coordinate System

## Coordinates

The coordinate system used in Calchart maintains the origin on the top-left of the field, i.e. the southwest corner of the field. Coordinates are given in steps from this origin, with the positive x-axis going towards the north endzone and the positive y-axis going towards the east sideline.

## Angles

Calchart measures angles from the east sideline, going clockwise. In documentation, these angle measurements may be referred to as "Calchart degrees". So 0 Calchart degrees is east, 90 Calchart degrees is south, 180 is west, and 270 is north.
